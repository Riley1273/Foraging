    Project Description </p>

  <p class="info" id="leftinfo">
    Inspired by my interest in mushroom foraging, this project attempts to replicate the feeling of searching for mushrooms
    in nature. Within the forest are 4 different types of mushrooms, although you may not always be able to find all 4 of them. As
    you search for the mushrooms, you can move around to different parts in the forest. Upon finding a mushroom, hovering over it will 
    display information about the mushroom you have found. All 4 types of mushrooms in this forest are poisonous, representing the 
    potential dangers of hunting for mushrooms in real life.  </p>

    Instructions</p>
  
  <p class="info" id="rightinfo">
    1) Hold down your mouse and drag over the canvas to move through the forest. <br>
    2) If you find a mushroom, hover your mouse over it (no need to press), to display an informational page about the mushroom. <br>
    3) To return to the forest, simply move your mouse away from the mushroom.</p>
